# Epidemiology in NHANES

## What is this repository?
This repository provides a **worked example of using wearables data available in NHANES for an epidemiological analysis associating daily step count with the risk of all-cause mortality**. Analyses are based on [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169649) and [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003487) conducted in the UK Biobank.

## What is this repository **not**? 
Analytic decisions should be made in the context of each research project. Choices in this repository reflect choices of the authors in the linked papers and the code authors, and should not be interpreted as definitive or widely generalisable. This repository is associated with the authors alone, and is not endorsed by UK Biobank.
